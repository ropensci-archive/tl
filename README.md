The goal of tl is to provide an R equivalent to the tldr command line tool, a community-contributed set of quick reference guides for R functions.

Briefly forgotten how a function works? Don't want to scroll through a long help file to find the example usage? You need tl;dr!

Installation
------------

You can install the current version of tl from [github](https://github.com) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/tl")
```

Examples
--------

Here are some basic examples of how to use tl:

Use the `dr` function to find a help page

``` r
tl::dr(lm)
```

> ``` r
> fits a linear model
>
> - fits a linear model of y dependent on x1 and x2
>   m1 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)
>
> - fits on data in data frame df
>   m1 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df)
>
> - fits model of y on categorical variable xc
>   m1 <- lm(y ~ as.factor(xc), data = df)
>
> - print model
>   summary(m1)
> ```

``` r
tl::dr(tidyr::gather)
```

> ``` r
> tidyr::gather
>
> converts data from wide to long
>
> - collapse columns x1 to x5 into 5 rows
>   gather(data, key = "key", value = "value", x1:x5)
>
> - collapse all columns
>   gather(data, key = "key", value = "value")
> ```

Page you are looking for does not exist? Use the `create_page` function to make one! Please follow the instructions to keep it brief.

``` r
tl::create_page(base::system.file)
```

Want to submit your new page to the `tl` package? Use the `submit_page` function to get instructions on how to add your help page to `tl`.

``` r
tl::submit_page(base::system.file)
```
